== Installation ==

Soccer Info is really easy to install so just follow the guide:

1. Upload the `soccer-info` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install it from the repository
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Now you may add Soccer Info's shortcodes into any post or page
4. Or use the plugin's widget

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've just activated Soccer Info, what do I need to do now? =

You are now able to add the shortcodes that displays the tables (fixtures or results) to any of your posts or pages. 
For example: `[soccer-info id='1' type='table' /]`
That means you want to display the ranking `table` (type) of the soccer league with the id=1 (Spanish Primera Division)
You will find the whole list of the soccer leagues supported by the plugin on the `Settings` > `Soccer Info` page.

= I don't know how to use shortcodes, what should I do then? =

For your confort, we added a function to the post/page editor that automatically generates and inserts the shortcodes for you. You will be prompted to select the league (and some other info) and then just click `Insert`
It sounds easy. Isn't is?

= Does this plugin have a widget? =

Yes, and it's easy to use.

= I have another question. Where can I ask that? =
